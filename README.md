**Quote of the hour:**

A program is like a poem: you cannot write a poem without writing it. Yet people talk about programming as if it were a production process and measure â€žprogrammer productivityâ€œ in terms of â€žnumber of lines of code producedâ€œ. In so doing they book that number on the wrong side of the ledger: We should always refer to â€žthe number of lines of code spentâ€œ.

~ Edsger W. Dijkstra
