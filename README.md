**Quote of the hour:**

A program is like a poem: you cannot write a poem without writing it. Yet people talk about programming as if it were a production process and measure ‚Äûprogrammer productivity‚Äú in terms of ‚Äûnumber of lines of code produced‚Äú. In so doing they book that number on the wrong side of the ledger: We should always refer to ‚Äûthe number of lines of code spent‚Äú.

~ Edsger W. Dijkstra
