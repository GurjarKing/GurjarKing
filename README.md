**Quote of the hour:**

The notions of correctness in mathematics and programs are different. A mathematical model must be consistent; it need not match reality (be correct), and it need not be complete (in the formal sense). A program model must be consistent; it must match reality; and it must be complete (in the sense that it reacts gracefully to all inputs).
