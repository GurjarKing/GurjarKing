**Quote of the hour:**

Modern programming scares me in many respects. It confuses me to read a program which you must read top-down. It says ‚Äúdo something.‚Äù And you go find ‚Äúsomething.‚Äù And you read it and it says, ‚Äúdo something else‚Äù and you go find something and it says, ‚Äúdo something else‚Äù and it goes back to the top maybe. And nothing gets done. It‚Äôs just relegating the problem to a deeper and deeper level.
