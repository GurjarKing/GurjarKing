**Quote of the hour:**

When you build a prototype, there is always the risk that someone will say "that's good enough, ship it". One way to minimize the risk of a prototype being put into production is to write the prototype in using a language or tool that you couldn't possibly use for a production version.

~ Joseph Yoder (computer scientist)
