**Quote of the hour:**

Reviews and pair programming provide programmers with something their work would not otherwise have: an audience. Sunlight, it is said is a powerful disinfectant. An immediate audience of one's peers provides immediate incentives to programmers to keep their code clear and comprehensible, as well as functional.

~ Joseph Yoder (computer scientist)
